        "Q.1)What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Interpreted languages, like Python, execute code directly line by line at runtime without the need for prior compilation. Compiled languages, such as C or Java, convert code into machine language before execution, which typically allows for faster execution times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.2)What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Exception handling in Python involves using try and except blocks to catch errors that would otherwise stop the execution of the program. It allows the program to react to exceptions gracefully without crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.3)What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The finally block in Python's exception handling framework is executed no matter what, whether an exception is raised or not. It's typically used for clean-up actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.4)What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Logging in Python involves recording events in a file or in other output streams while a program runs. It provides a way of tracking activities, especially useful for debugging and understanding program behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.5)What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The __del__ method, known as a destructor, is called when an instance is about to be destroyed. This can be useful for clean-up processes, like closing files or connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.6)What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    import imports a module and requires referencing its namespace to access functions, classes, etc. from ... import allows importing specific attributes or functions directly into the current namespace, which simplifies access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.7)How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except clauses, specifying each exception type to handle them differently, or using a single except clause with a tuple of exception types to handle them in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.8)What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and clean-up tasks in a block. For files, it ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.9)What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multithreading involves running multiple threads in a single process, sharing the same memory space, while multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space, which can run on different processors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.10)What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Logging provides a way to continuously monitor what happens in a program, which is crucial for debugging and understanding program flow. It can also be useful for audit trails, error reporting, and analytics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.11)What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Memory management in Python is handled by the Python memory manager. It includes allocation of memory to objects and garbage collection, which frees up memory by destroying objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.12)What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The basic steps are: defining a try block in which you place the code that might cause an exception, following it with except blocks to handle any exceptions that arise, and optionally including a finally block for clean-up actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.13)Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Effective memory management ensures that the program runs efficiently by allocating and deallocating memory as needed, which prevents memory leaks and optimizes program performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.14)What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    try and except blocks in Python are used to catch and handle exceptions respectively. try block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the except block contains the code that executes if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.15)How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Python's garbage collection system works by counting references to objects in memory and collecting those objects that have no more references pointing to them, using a form of automatic memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.16)What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The else block in Python's exception handling runs if the try block did not raise an exception. It allows for code that should only execute if the try block was successful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.17)What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The common logging levels in Python are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, which indicate the severity of the events that are being logged.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.18)What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    os.fork() is used to fork the current process into two processes run by the OS, while multiprocessing is a module that allows you to create processes that run in parallel, each with its own Python interpreter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.19)What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Closing a file in Python is important to free up system resources and ensure that all changes made to the file are written properly. It prevents data corruption and allows other processes or programs to access the file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q.20)What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    file.read() reads the entire content of the file into a single string. file.readline(), on the other hand, reads and returns one line at a time, including the newline character at the end of each line.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q.21)What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The logging module in Python is used for tracking events that occur during the execution of a program. It allows developers to write status messages to a file or other output streams. This module provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q.22)What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The os module in Python provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like creating, removing, and changing directory paths, fetching their contents, and working with file attributes. It is especially useful for file handling tasks such as renaming and deleting files.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q.23)What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Challenges include managing memory leaks, which occur when unused memory is not returned to the heap or memory pool. Another challenge is handling the overhead of Python's garbage collection, which can impact performance, especially in memory-intensive applications.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q.24)How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    You can raise an exception manually with the raise statement. For example, raise ValueError(\"A value error occurred.\") throws a ValueError with the specified error message.\n",
        "\n",
        " Q.25)Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Multithreading is important for improving the performance of applications that perform multiple tasks at the same time. It allows a program to handle concurrent operations, making it ideal for tasks like I/O operations, real-time processing, and handling user interfaces."
